## 4/25/2024 - A Slight Pause In Development

Due to work and relocating, I will be taking a brief pause in development for this software. I plan to pick development back up in late June/beginning of July this year. Feel free to open issues, but know that I myself won't be getting to them for some time. I will gladly take pull requests in the meantime. Thanks for the support!

## Features

- **Discord Integration:** Directly send your RSS feed updates to a Discord channel via a webhook.
- **Ease of Setup:** Configuration is a breeze with a simple JSON file. Just add your Webhook URL & RSS Feeds.
- **Docker Support:** Deploying with Docker makes your life easier and is highly recommended.

## Quick Setup (Docker)

### Setting up appsettings.json

Your `appsettings.json` is a collection of `instances:`

```json
{
    "Instances": [],
}
```

Each webhook gets one `instance`. Here's an example of a single instance:

```json
{
     "Id": "Gaming News Channel",
     "RssUrls": [
       "https://examplesrssfeed1.com/rss",
       "https://examplesrssfeed2.com/rss",
       "https://examplesrssfeed3.com/rss",
     ],
     "YoutubeUrls": [ "" ],
     "DiscordWebhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
     "RssCheckIntervalMinutes": 3,
     "EnableAutoRemove": true,
     "Color": 8411391,
     "DescriptionLimit": 200,
     "Forum": true
}
```

Here is an appsettings.json example of running two webhooks for two different channels:

```json
{
	"Instances": [
		{
			"Id": "Gaming News Channel",
			"Username": "Gaming News",
			"RssUrls": [
				"https://examplesrssfeed1.com/rss",
				"https://examplesrssfeed2.com/rss",
				"https://examplesrssfeed3.com/rss"
			],
			"YoutubeUrls": [ "" ],
			"DiscordWebhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
			"RssCheckIntervalMinutes": 3,
			"EnableAutoRemove": true,
			"Color": 8411391,
			"DescriptionLimit": 200,
			"Forum": true
		},
		{
			"Id": "Tech News Channel",
			"Username": "Tech News",
			"RssUrls": [
				"https://examplesrssfeed4.com/rss",
				"https://examplesrssfeed5.com/rss",
				"https://examplesrssfeed6.com/rss"
			],
			"YoutubeUrls": [ "" ],
			"DiscordWebhookUrl": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
			"RssCheckIntervalMinutes": 3,
			"EnableAutoRemove": true,
			"Color": 8411391,
			"DescriptionLimit": 200,
			"Forum": true
		}
	]
}
```

There are more optional properties to configure. You can view all properties and their purpose [here](https://github.com/Qolors/FeedCord/blob/master/FeedCord/docs/reference.md)

### Setting up docker-compose.yaml

Your `docker-compose.yaml` will look be set up like this:

```yaml
version: "3.9"

services:
  myfeedcord:
    image: qolors/feedcord:latest # for amd64 architecture
    # image: qolors/feedcord:latest-arm64  # For arm64 architecture (Uncomment this line and comment the above if using arm64)
    container_name: FeedCord
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - ./PATH/TO/MY/JSON/FILE/appsettings.json:/app/config/appsettings.json
```

Replace `./PATH/TO/MY/JSON/FILE/` with the actual path to your `appsettings.json`.

**Note:** Depending on your architecture, use `qolors/feedcord:latest` for amd64 architecture, or `qolors/feedcord:latest-arm64` for arm64 architecture. Ensure to uncomment the appropriate line in the docker-compose.yml as per your system's architecture. If you need a different please open a request.

---

### Running FeedCord

In the folder you created, run the following command from your terminal:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will pull the latest FeedCord image from Docker Hub and start the service.

If you want to update your current image to latest it's quite simple. In your FeedCord directory run:
```
docker-compose pull
```
followed by
```
docker-compose up -d
```
This will pull the latest image and restart your current container with it

---

## Done

With the above steps completed, FeedCord should now be running and posting updates from your RSS feeds directly to your Discord channel.
